title: Welcome to the Garden
---

This is an Obsidian blog, or a Knowledge Graph exported as a website. Also known as a Digital Garden by many.

Why Garden? Like when you stroll in an actual garden, you end up finding all types of new flowers and insects, somehow you are more curious, you stop sometimes and observe such things that make you curious. And then you move on to another part of the garden. The next when you visit the garden, you can expect to find something new. And this repeats everytime.

This website is meant to generate a similar curiosity while strolling the digital garden. A reader can stop by and read the things that they find interesting and then decided whether to go deep within or continue to another part of the garden. Every time you visit, the old topics you have already read, might have some additional data or insight added. 

Here are some resources to start with:
1. All topic level explorations can be found under [Vibhuti](Vibhuti/). Vibhuti in this case means Wealth of Knowledge.
2. A journal type column [Daily Notes](Vibhuti/DailyNotes/) will take you through some specific days, they may include further brainstormings on topics discussed under Vibhuti.
3. [Projects](Vibhuti/Projects/) will take you through all the wilderness of ideas I have been through or currently traversing

The Garden contains a lot of resources, not all are worth publishing. What gets published, are generally things that I presume worth sharing. Refrences to the garden are always prvided in the published essays, interested readers can be guided to Vibhuti where they can spend time exploring in depth. Like every garden has an entry and exit point and paths within itself, we need a pathway for a digital garden as well, and that is achieved by an email newsletter I have linked below. I recommend subscribing so that you don't miss new happenings in the garden:

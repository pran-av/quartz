1. **What is the difference between reality and imagination?** 
	1. From my current understanding of the world, I believe anything that most people believe turns out to be real - that means a thing does not have to be physical or perceived through physical senses and still it can be real. A good and universal example is the concept of money and the mechanism of currencies. #reality #imagination
	3. It is magnificent how brain manages to process feedback from all the senses mixed with the brain's self generated content and manage to classify what's real and what's imagined.
	4. The brain must be running some rule engines wherein based on experiences, higher weights are assigned to things that are most likely real. These weight might be used in real time processing of feedback for separating real and imaginary. For instance, think of the first time as a kid you realised what money was. Or think of you getting a call asking for some money, how's your brain classifying if this caller is someone really in need or a scammer.
	5. This paper titled 'Subjective signal strength distinguishes reality from imagination' tries to explain how the brain differentiates between reality and imagination through a reality threshold. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37322-1
	6. Since every brain can have its own reality threshold, reality and imagination can be just an individual perspective. Additionally there can be a reality threshold for a community of people, for the people of a country, for humans as a species, and so on.
	7. Will an AI have its own reality threshold? As basics, the current AI models in market do suffer with hallucinations where they output made up things - so I would say yes.
2. **Our body is a real estate housing trillions of microbes**
	1. My first thought to this is, what's the chance we can control them? Like every product that has advanced settings - I believe we have not yet unlocked that advanced settings for the human body. #microbiome
	2. This research 'The person-to-person transmission landscape of the gut and oral microbiomes' https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05620-1 indirectly suggest human microbiomes can be something like fingerprints that can suggest the social circles and close individuals and relationships between humans.
3. **Mitochondria may not just be the energy house of cells**
	1. Researchers have found that mitochondria are also time keepers within the cells. The dictate the pace of growth within neurons or embryos.
	2. Does this mean we can introduce more mitochondria or reduce them to change the pace of development within cells? Can there be something like rapid healing where mitochondria are directly stimulated to generate more energy and increase counts to heal quickly?

#orbital_mechanics 

A two burn mechanism to raise the orbit or lower the orbit of a vehicle within gravitational influence. The orbits in reference here are circular orbits. Following phases are involved:
1. Departure Burn
2. Coast Phase -- the vehicle is in elliptical trajectory in this case
3. Arrival Burn

Hohmann transfer is considered to be the most fuel efficient transfer process. To calculate the fuel spent, the difference in pre burn and post burn orbital velocities is calculated. This difference from both the burns is added up to identify total delta for orbital velocity.

This delta can be used in further calculations to identify fuel spent.

Hohmann transfers are based on principles on conservation of Kinetic and Potential Energy. For instance, if a satellite is orbiting in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), to not fall back to Earth, the satellite has to maintain higher velocities compared to orbits farther away from Earth.

Hence, LEO satellite having a high Kinetic Energy but Low Potential Energy will have a higher Potential and low Kinetic Energy when transferred to a higher orbit.

$KE_1 + PE_1 = KE_2 + PE_2$

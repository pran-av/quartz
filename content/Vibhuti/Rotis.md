Chappati/Bread: Made of Wheat and Maida
Bhakri: Made of Jowar or Bajra

Many more breads across India are made from other millets like Ragi, etc

Use of wheat for making bread is something that happened most likely post Green Revolution when Wheat production was encouraged. Millets production likely reduced during these times.

Today government is bringing back millets to the staple.

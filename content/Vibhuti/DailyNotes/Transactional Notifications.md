#### Transactional Notifications
#product 
1. Subject line that communicates the entire context as much as possible
2. Body should be in a simple language and concise enough
3. CTA for more details

Examples:
1. ![[Transaction_Notifications_1.jpeg]]Issues:
	1. Did not send me a tracking link to click on, I had to search Shiprocket on google
	2. Did not send me an estimate of delivery either, I had to spend extra time exploring
	Pros:
	1. Notify customer of order being received
	2. Notify customer of recent status of order being approved along with an Order ID
	3. Notify customer that the item was shipped
2. ![[TransactionNotifications_2.jpeg]]Issues:
	1. Does not tell customer when to expect the delivery
	2. Does not share a tracking link
	Pros:
	1. 'Order Packed' -- context shared without requiring to open full SMS
	2. Provides details of the SKU that has been packed
3. ![[TransactionNotification3.jpeg]]![[TransactionNotification4.jpeg]]
	1. Uber processed an adjusted refund, but did not mention the same in email subject line, the customer would not have known if they did not click on it.
	2. Swiggy successful orders clearly communicate so in the subject itself
	3. Both emails have a CTA to download a pdf version of invoice

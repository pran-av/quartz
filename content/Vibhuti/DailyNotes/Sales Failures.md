#### Sales Failures
#sales

1. **What To Sell:** Targets should not just be focused on incentives, what to sell also matter. More like, this incentive is this is sold. What is being sold should in turn align within the business strategy -- that selling this has a long term benefit.
	1. SKU Management plays a good role of restricting 'what is sold'. But things like, unrealistic promises made during sales cannot be solved via OMS.
	2. UI communication to the customer directly can help limit unrealistic promises cases, as the user is educated directly on features, etc. UI also helps sales make lesser mistakes while pitching.
	3. **How to identify if the problem exists?** Sales targets are reached but NPS is low. NPS can be in form of survey feedbacks, calls, any form on communication from customer directly related to the post purchase services. #NPS
2. **Incentives that promote longterm thinking:** Today's rejection can be tomorrow's success. More incentives on converting a rejection.
	1. **How to identify if the sales team has short term mindset?** The company always needs X funnel to convert Y leads. The funnel input should not always be proportional to conversion growth.
	2. What should be the relationship between funnel input and lead conversions? To Be Explored
3. **Incentive on Invoice generation is a non-customer centric mechanism:** Instead incentives can be credited when the first 'purchase satisfaction/confirmation' happens for the customer. This can be post some basic onboarding or customer confirming the purchase.
		1. An automated onboarding process is very resourceful for this reason, Ex: right after successful purchase, customer gets a whatsapp message to confirm serviceability. 
		2. The time to confirmation can be reduced to release incentives faster.
		3. Success Metric: Increased NPS, which subsequently may lead to renewals and upgrades
4. **Tracking of reasons for lost leads:** This should be one of the main inputs of the product roadmap. 
	1. Product should validate problems before implementing sales features. Sales leaders can be prone to identifying non-problems or non-solutions.
	2. Same case can happen with B2B: Customers can think a problem exists but in actual the problem might be something very different. Important for product to explore the problems themselves.

I believe there's a difference between business vision and founders vision. 

I even believe that business vision is the most crucial amongst the two. Having a business vision for a company is like our body wanting to breathe air, it means survival. But although air is so crucial for our bodies, when was the last time you heard someone say that they live to breathe air?

We survive by breathing air, but we don't prosper by doing the same. A company might survive on a business vision, but does it prosper?

I believe Founders vision plays that role of making a company prosper. Prosper by means of what? By differentiating one from competition, by motivating employees to put in extra efforts, by creating an emotional bond instead of a transactional one, by giving enough room to think differently.

Who should create this 'Founders' vision? There's a reason I didn't write it as 'Founder's'. I believe everyone within an organisation can put efforts in defining this vision.

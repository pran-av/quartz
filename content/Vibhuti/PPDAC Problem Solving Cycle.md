My first introduction to this methodology came from the book 'The Art of Statistics' by David Spiegelhalter. 

The problem solving methodology used in statistics to reach conclusions. The steps include,
1. **Define the Problem**: Identify what the problem is - try to define the problem as an independent question. What are the ways we can answer this question? Is there a worthwhile outcome from answering this question?
2. **Sketch the Plan**: What do we measure so that we can solve the question? How do we measure and collect this data?
3. **Structure the Data**: How do we structure and clean the data?
4. **Run an Analysis:** Identify the patterns, find the best way to communicate and understand the data via graphs.
5. **Conclusion:** Get an answer to the question, identify the next question that links the current question.

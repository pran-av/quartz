Hamburger Menu and Navbar should be fixed at top of the screen in both MWEB and Desktop cases, so these options are always available to the user.

### Logo and Language Selector
On Scroll, fixed to top for both MWEB and Desktop designs.
Language selector should have all major Indian language translations.

### Landing Page
1. One liner + Pitch
	1. Bigger Font: A single catchy one line to convey what StBroseph does
	2. Smaller Font: Two to Three additional sentences that can play the role of a pitch for users to click on the CTAs
2. Impact - convey quantitative data
	1. 500+ hrs social work every day
	2. 5000+ volunteers
	3. 300+ coordinators
	4. 3 cities
3. CTAs that directly relate to the goal
	1. Primary CTA should be allowing user to raise an issue or download the app - allow user to connect on whatsapp for immediate issue or take them to playstore for app download
		- In case app is not launched in playstore, only allow user to connect directly on WA for issues
		- Solid Button
	2. Secondary CTA should be allowing users to get involved - take user to separate get involved page on click
		- Transparent/lighter button with a border
4. The above 3 points should be within the first section of the MWEB or WEB screen where user can access CTAs without any scroll.
	- On CTA click open an new url and take user to this new url
5. On Scroll: Fix the Primary CTA on Bottom (bottom because the CTA is more accessible for mobile users - for desktop website it can be at top). 'Live in Bangalore? Download the App.'

	2. Convey that the user's problem are definitely going to be solved -- convey this with 
6. Why Reach Out to StBroseph and Testimonials
	- Two three sentences - context about when people reach out to us and how we ensure all queries go unanswered
	- Above followed by anonymised testimonials in quotes type design
	- Featured In: Press Articles with logos and links that open in new tab
7. Scroll Ends - App Splash: The fixed button opens up into this last section
	1. Explain user Why Download Now? Three points giving the reason.
	2. Allow to connect on whatsapp for immediate issues
	3. Back to Top button
8. UI Ideas: 
	1. Can Freedom Wall images be used across the website or atleast within the Landing page to inspire or subconsciously set a helping tone?
	2. What else can be done to communicate to the user that "your problem will be solved!"?
	3. Colors should be in-line with the logo design, but may be a lighter and mellow shades within the pallet - maybe communicate warmth?

If an object is travelling in a three dimensional space, wherein the directions are defined as x, y, and z axis.
#### Position Vector

Then the position of the object relative to the origin at any given time $t$ is,

$r(t) = x(t)\hat i + y(t)\hat j + z(t) \hat k$

$\hat i , \hat j, \hat k$ are called unit vectors, that is it defines 1 unit distance in each directions. The term 'vector' here signifies that a quantity is directional in nature. Compared 'scaler' in a non-directional nature of a quantity.

To find the distance of the object from origin, we need to apply [[pythagorus theorem]] to each individual planar region, on computation we get a following formula for distance in a 3D space:

$|r| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

### Velocity Vector

The first derivative of position vector will give us the coordinates of velocity vectors in each direction.

$v(t) = \frac{dr(t)}{dt}$

### Acceleration Vector

The second derivation of position vector,

$a(t) = \frac{d^2r(t)}{dt^2}$

**Context:**
- I joined the company on 4th of May 2024. From what I remember the Cart Flow in the website flows was already built by this time, but the cart flow in android app was yet to be deployed. The stories were given in March and the deployment was completed in October. 
- v1 and v2: The Cart Flow was the third version of Subscriptions - before this their was Tier Pricing (I am not 100% sure if and how long this was available) and a shift into Package Pricing.
- v3: Cart Flow was meant to let users purchase multiple packages in a single go - to increase AOV or ARPU. There might be other reasons that it was implemented.
- v4: Cart Flow modifications to have a consistent FE and BE logics while we try to launch all variety of packages based on market requirements.

**Subscriptions v1:** Tier Pricing, the aim of this type of pricing is its simplicity - best for cases where user is buying by themselves and the market needs are simply enough to avoid multiple tiers with different combination of features.
